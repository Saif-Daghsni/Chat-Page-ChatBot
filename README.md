# Project Description

This repository contains the work I completed during my internship at BIZ Experience, where I developed a full-stack web application and an intelligent chatbot using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

The project had two main components:

Interactive Web Application: Designed and built a platform that enables real-time messaging, offer publishing (buy/sell), transaction management, and user-friendly navigation.

Chatbot Integration: Developed a smart assistant for the R&D department, combining a FAQ-based knowledge base with Fuse.js for fuzzy search and an AI-powered API (Mistral-7B-Instruct) for dynamic responses.

ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js + Express.js

Database: MongoDB (with MongoDB Compass for management)

Design & Collaboration: Figma, Git, GitHub

Other tools: Visual Studio Code, Fuse.js, API integration for AI

ðŸš€ Key Features

Real-time chat interface with text, images, and transaction commands

Offer management system (buy/sell offers, negotiation, history, sharing)

Intelligent chatbot capable of answering R&D-related queries

Fuzzy search to handle spelling errors and query variations

Integration of external AI model for flexible and accurate responses

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in full-stack development, project collaboration, and AI integration while delivering real value to the hosting company.
